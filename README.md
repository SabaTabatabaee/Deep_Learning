 These are the steps we take:
 1. Initialize the weights and biases
 2. Iteratively repeat following steps:
    
    1.Calculate network output using forward propagation
    
    2.Calculate error between ground truth and estimated or predicted output
    
    3.Update weights and biases through backpropagation
    
    4.Repeat the above three steps until the number of iterations/epoches is reached or error between ground truth and predicted output is below a predefined threshold
